# GuardMobs
GuardMobs! Buggy? Messy? Somewhat unstable? Of course it is! *I* wrote it after all.

There's still much to be done. Revive tokens are WIP. Timed guardmob inventory deletion post-death is next. Hostility is up after that.

Current Dependencies:
-WorldEdit-
-WorldGuard-
-Vault-

Note To Self: Spawn items and spawning in general needs rework to neatly fit revival tokens. Does not look pretty at the moment.
